Impact:
By making education on all OWASP lists accessible, engaging, and practical, we're helping organizations build stronger security postures, reduce vulnerabilities across multiple attack vectors (including emerging AI and LLM threats) and create a more security-aware workforce. This directly contributes to OWASP's mission of making software security visible and measurable across all technological domains, including the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies.

### Road Map
* Create a set of 4 initial system map boards on the top 10 AI and top 10 LLM.
* 19 Team Building Extension Cards downloadable and printable
* New System Map Boards with different types of scenarios and different threats
