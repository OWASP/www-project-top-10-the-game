Cybersecurity education and training often suffer from being too theoretical, complex, or disconnected from real-world scenarios. Traditional learning methods fail to engage professionals effectively, leading to knowledge gaps in critical OWASP vulnerabilities ([Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/), [API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x00-header/), [Mobile Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/), [IoT Top 10](https://ot.owasp.org/), [AI Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/), [LLM Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/), etc.) that remain the most exploited attack vectors year after year.

## Introduction 

OWASP Top 10 The Game is a gamified and interactive learning experience that transforms cybersecurity training to make it more engaging, practical, and collaborative. It focuses on the most critical real-world vulnerabilities described by OWASP, turning learning into a fun activity that fosters teamwork and builds a strong security culture, all in an accessible, free-to-play format.
